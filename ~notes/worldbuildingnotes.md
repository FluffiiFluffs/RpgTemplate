	3 stages: Dormant, Awakened, Exalted (allows evolution and growth)

“Audiences are ok with coincidences that get them into trouble, not out of it”
Tiered lieutenants (harder and harder until final boss)
Liuetenants are the mouthpiece for the final boss
Tier-based adventures
	Multiple story arcs with beginning, middle, end that play into the main story


The end of the game's difficulty should match the power of the party. Party has powerful skills, enemies have powerful skills too.
